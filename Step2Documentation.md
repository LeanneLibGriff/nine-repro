### Step 2

### Documentation

Throughout your research, you make many choices, from topic to methodology, from techniques to measurements, from data source to storage format. The choices you make at one stage will affect the choices you make at the next.  

For your research to be reproducible in the future, even by you, all those choices need to be documented and available. 

There may be more than one valid way to collect and to analyse data but if the same choices are not made later, the result may be different. Methods can vary, equipment may measure and record differently, approaches may have inherent biases for which adjustments need to be made. Each data point needs to be interpreted in the context in which it was collected. 

The choices made at the time may seem obvious, but it may not be so in future. Choices are often limited by methodology or technology but both may undergo changes or digital disruption after the project is over, or even during the project.  

Within a research group, another possible disruption is the loss of one of the members of the team. If that happens with someone whose role or skills are crucial to the project. Comprehensive documentation can be crucial to the future of the project when someone new takes over that role. 

## Bus Factor

Note:
Ideally you want to document anything that a lab member coming on board would need to know. Documentation is all about changing your Bus Factor - how many people on a project would need to be hit by a bus to make a project fail. Many times, projects can have a bus factor of one. Adding documentation means when someone goes on leave, needs to take leave suddenly or finishes their study, their work is preserved for your lab.


### Documentation will also be important for any audits in your lab or if someone would like to reproduce your research.

## How?

### Beginner 
* Read this first: [How to start Documenting and more by CESSDA ERIC](https://www.cessda.eu/Training/Training-Resources/Library/Data-Management-Expert-Guide/2.-Organise-Document/Documentation-and-metadata)<br/><br/>Start with documenting in a text file or document- any start is a good start<br/> Have this document automatically synced to the cloud with your data or keep this in a shared place such as Google docs, Microsoft teams or Owncloud

### Intermediate
* Once you have the basics in place, go into detail on how your workflow goes from your raw data to the finished results. This can be anything from a downloaded function list from SPSS/Virtual Lab to the code used to create it. 

### Advanced
* Now that you've got a good head start, time to learn about Git Repositories and wikis.  

### Internal Resources
* Wiki options at Griffith
* Wiki or using the documents in Teams
* [Research Space](https://research-storage.griffith.edu.au/)
* Griffith's Gitlab wiki options - talk to eResearch Support or Hacky Hour
