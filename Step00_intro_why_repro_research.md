## Introduction: Why reproducible research?

#### A basic tenet in science is the ability to replicate the results of any experiment. Replication verifies results; however, research papers often lack the detail required for independent replication. Many attempts at reproducing the results well-known scientific studies have failed in a variety of disciplines. 

Replicating studies with new data is expensive, for this reason computationally reproducible research is recommended as a way to assess the validity and rigor of scientific results. Research is considered reproducible when others can reproduce results of a study with only the original data, code and documentation. 

__Computational reproducibility isdefinedas the abilityto obtain consistent computational resultsusing the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and analysis conditions as thoseused in the original study. Computational reproducibility is a means of making scientific claims moretransparent. It is imperative for verifying and building upon reported findings, preserving a completescientific record, and enhancing pedagogical strategies for research methods training.

Reproducible research has most of the advantages of replicating studies without the financial and time burden associated with collecting new data. It is the by-product of care and attention to detail throughout the research process and seen as a minimum standard that all researchers should strive for.


**Benefits of reproducible research**

- Easier recall and explanation of work to collaborators, supervisors and reviewers
- Ability to quickly modify anlayses and figures
- Enables quick reconfiguration of research taska for new projects with similar tasks.
- Reproducible research is a strong indicator of rigour, trustworthiness and transparency. It can incease the quality and speed of peer review.
- Inceases in citation rates and expanded research impact through the ability to access and cite the project code and data.

This self-paced tutorial outlines ten steps to make your research reproducible, beginning with data quality or tidy data, documentation, management of sensitive data, through to the publication of datasets. 


By following these steps, you will not only improve on the quality of your research processes but facilitate the development of new and innovative research through good practice.
