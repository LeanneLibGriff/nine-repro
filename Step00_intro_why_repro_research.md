## Introduction: Replication vs Reproducible Research

#### A basic tenet in science is the ability to replicate the results of any experiment. Replication verifies results; however, research papers often lack the detail required for independent replication. Many attempts at replicating the results of well-known scientific studies have failed in a variety of disciplines. 

Replicating studies with new data is expensive, for this reason computationally reproducible research is recommended as a way to assess the validity and rigor of scientific results. Research is considered reproducible when others can reproduce results of a study with only the original data, code, conditions and documentation.

Reproducible research has most of the advantages of replicating studies without the financial and time burden associated with collecting new data. It is the by-product of care and attention to detail throughout the research process and seen as a minimum standard that all researchers should strive for.


**Benefits of reproducible research**

- Easier recall and explanation of work to collaborators, supervisors and reviewers
- Ability to quickly modify analyses and figures
- Facilitates quick reconfiguration of research tasks for new projects with similar tasks
- Reproducible research is a strong indicator of rigour, trustworthiness and transparency. It can increase the quality and speed of peer review
- Increases in citation rates and expanded research impact through the ability to access and cite the project code and data
- Enhances opportunities for research methods training

This self-paced tutorial outlines ten steps to make your research reproducible, beginning with data quality or tidy data, documentation, management of sensitive data, through to the publication of datasets. 


By following these steps, you will not only improve on the quality of your research processes but facilitate the development of new and innovative research through good practice.
