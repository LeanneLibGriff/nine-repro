## Introduction: Why reproducible research?

#### Replication is a fundamental principle of science but there is an increasing fear in the research community that too few studies are able to be replicated. Research is considered reproducible when the results of a study can be replicated with only the original data, code and documentation. 

#### Reproducible research is a by-product of care and attention to detail throughout the research process.

**Benefits of reproducible research**

- Easier recall and explanation of work to collaborators, supervisors and reviewers
- Ability to quickly modify anlyses and figures
- Enables quick reconfiguration of research tasks so that new projects with similar tasks are simpler and easier.
- Reproducible research is a strong indicator of rigor, trustworthiness and transparency. It can incease the quality and speed of peer review.
- Reproducible research inceases citation rates and allows other researchers to cite code and data as well as publications. Access to and the ability to cite code and data expands impact of the project more so than if the data or methods were unavailable.

#### Many attempted replications of well-known scientific studies have failed in a wide variety of disciplines and rates of article retractions are increasing. ###
