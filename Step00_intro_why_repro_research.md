## Introduction: Why reproducible research?

#### Replication is a fundamental tenet of science...  but there is growing concern in the research community that too few studies are able to be replicated. Research is considered reproducible when the results of a study can be reproduced with only the original data, code and documentation. 

#### Reproducible research is a by-product of care attention to detail throughout the research process.


**Benefits of reproducible research**


- Easier recall and explanation of work to collaborators, supervisor and reviewers
- Ability to quickly modify anlyses and figures
- Enables quick reconfiguration of research tasks so that new projects with similar tasks are simpler and easier.
- Reproducible research is a strong indicator of rigor, trustworthiness and transparency. It can incease the quality of speed of peer review.
- Reproducible research inceases paper citation rates and allows other researchers to cite code and data in addition to publications. This enables a given research project to have more impact than it would if the data or methods were hidden from the public.

#### Many attempted replications of well-known scientific studies have failed in a wide variety of disciplines and rates of paper retractions are increasing. ###
