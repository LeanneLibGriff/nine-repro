## Introduction: Why reproducible research?

### Replication is a fundamental tenet of science... but there is a growing concern in the research community that too few studies are able to be replicated. Research is considered reprodicible when others can replicate the results of a study given only the original data, code and documentation. REproducible research is a by-product of care attention to detail throughout the research process... it ensures that the researcher can repeat the same analyusis multiple times with the same result, at any point in the process.

**Benefits of reproducible research**


- Easier recall and explanation of work to collaborators, supervisor and reviewers

- Enables quick reconfigureation of previously conducted research tasks so that new projects with similar task are simpler and easier.
- Reproducible research is a stron indicator to other research of rigor, trustworthiness and transparency. It can incease the quality of speed of peer review.
- Reproducible research inceases papter citation rates adn allows other researchers to cite code and data in addition to publications. This enables a given research project to have more impact than it would if the data or methods were hidden from the public.
