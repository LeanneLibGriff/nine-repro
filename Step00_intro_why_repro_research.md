## Introduction: Why reproducible research?

#### Replication is a fundamental principle of science. Replication verifies results and can confirm the findings of the original experiment; however, research papers often lack the detail required for independent replication. Many attempts at reproducing the results well-known scientific studies have failed in a variety of disciplines. There is a fear in the research community that too few studies are able to be replicated and the number of papers being retracted due to a lack of reproducibilty is increasing. 

Research is considered reproducible when others can reproduce results of a study with only the original data, code and documentation.

Reproducible research has most of the advantages of replicating studies without the financial and time burden associated with collecting new data.


#### Reproducible research is a by-product of care and attention to detail throughout the research process.

**Benefits of reproducible research**

- Easier recall and explanation of work to collaborators, supervisors and reviewers
- Ability to quickly modify anlayses and figures
- Enables quick reconfiguration of research taska for new projects with similar tasks.
- Reproducible research is a strong indicator of rigour, trustworthiness and transparency. It can incease the quality and speed of peer review.
- Inceases in citation rates and expanded research impact through the ability to access and cite the project code and data.

#### Many attempted replications of well-known scientific studies have failed in a wide variety of disciplines and rates of article retractions are increasing. ###
