#### How to create strong passwords
 * Make your password unique for each of your important accounts.
 * Make your password longer - at least 12 characters long. 14 or more characters is stronger.
 * Use a combination of letters, lowercase letters and symbols.

 * Do not incorporate personal information into your password. For example, the name of a child, pet, important birthdays, details from your address.

#### Encrypt your hard drive
