### Step 7
## Cloud Storage of your Data
---


Cloud storage provides a convenient way to store, back up and retrieve data. 

At Griffith, three types of data storage are available to researchers

#### [Research Drive](https://research-storage.griffith.edu.au/drive/)
Research Drive is a good option for your day-to-day working files. It is unlimited and can be shared with your Griffith collaborators (but not externally).

---
#### [Research Space](https://research-storage.griffith.edu.au/space/manual/)

This option has a 'sync' client that automatically copies your files from your computer to the cloud - similar to DropBox or Google Drive.
Research Space can be used to share data with collaborators external to the university. Collaborators can be added using a
Linkedin profile, Griffith, other university or Gmail account, or you can share with a URL, password and expiry date. 
Research space has unlimited storage. You are initially provided 5GB of space; to add an unlimited fold, just click "Add more storage".

---
#### [Research Vault](https://research-storage.griffith.edu.au/vault/)

For your long term backups. Perfect place to store a safe copy of your raw data or the research of your PhD student who has completed and is leaving the institute.
