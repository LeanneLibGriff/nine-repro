### Step 7
## Cloud Storage of your Data
---

Cloud storage provides a convenient way to store, back up and retrieve data. Well chosen storage solutions will simplify version control and collaboration with others.  It protects research data against computer failure, hard drive corruption and accidental deletion by making research data restoreable. 

Choosing the right storage solution will be determined by a number of factors. Some things to consider include contractual requirements of funding bodies, legal requirements to retain or discard data, as well as best practices in your field.

Major funders of Australian research, the Australian Research Council (ARC) and the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) include data management requirements in their funding agreements.

At Griffith, three types of data storage are available to researchers

#### [Research Drive](https://research-storage.griffith.edu.au/drive/)
Research Drive is a good option for your day-to-day working files. It is unlimited and can be shared with your Griffith collaborators (but not externally).

---
#### [Research Space](https://research-storage.griffith.edu.au/space/manual/)

This option has a 'sync' client that automatically copies your files from your computer to the cloud - similar to DropBox or Google Drive.
Research Space allows data sharing with collaborators external to Griffith. Collaborators can be added using a
Linkedin profile, Griffith, other university or Gmail account, or you can share with a URL, password and expiry date. 
Research space has unlimited storage. Initially, you are provided 5GB of space, to add an unlimited folder click "Add more storage".

---
#### [Research Vault](https://research-storage.griffith.edu.au/vault/)

For long term storage and backup of data. The Research Vault is suited to store safe copy of your raw data or the research of your completed PhD student who is leaving the institute.
